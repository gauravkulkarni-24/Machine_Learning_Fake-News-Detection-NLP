# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

Fake news spreads rapidly on digital platforms and social media, making it difficult to trust online information.  
This project focuses on building a **machine learning-based NLP system** to classify news articles as **Fake or Real** using textual data.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning models** to detect fake news articles.  
The core idea is to clean and preprocess textual data, extract meaningful features using **TF-IDF**, and train classification models such as **Naive Bayes** and **Random Forest**.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two CSV files:

- **True.csv** → Real news articles  
- **Fake.csv** → Fake news articles  

Each file contains:
- `title` – News headline
